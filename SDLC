# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Overview

This document outlines the five classic phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  
The SDLC provides a structured approach to building high-quality software systems efficiently and effectively.

---

## 1. Requirements Gathering and Analysis
- Understand what the users need.
- Document both functional and non-functional requirements.
- Analyze the feasibility from technical, financial, and legal perspectives.

## 2. Design
- Plan the overall architecture of the system.
- Create system models, database designs, wireframes, and process diagrams.
- Decide on technologies, frameworks, and tools.
- Focus on how the system will operate internally and externally.

## 3. Implementation (or Development)
- Write the code based on the finalized design documents.
- Develop features, integrations, database schemas, user interfaces, and backend logic.
- Perform unit testing during development to catch issues early.

## 4. Testing
- Validate that the software meets all specified requirements.
- Conduct various types of testing, including:
  - Unit Testing
  - Integration Testing
  - System Testing
  - Acceptance Testing
- Identify, track, and fix bugs or issues found during testing.

## 5. Deployment and Maintenance
- Deploy the software to production environments or deliver it to end-users.
- Monitor system performance, security, and user feedback.
- Address any issues post-deployment through patches, updates, and enhancements.
- Continuously maintain and improve the system over time.

> **Note:**  
While traditionally presented linearly, many modern development approaches (such as Agile and DevOps) encourage iterative revisiting of these phases to continuously enhance software quality and user satisfaction.
